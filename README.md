 What This Is

A simple web page that demonstrates JavaScript event listeners. Three UI elements each trigger a change on the page when interacted with.


What Each Element Does

**Button** — Clicking the button randomly changes the background color of the page.

**Text Input** — Typing your name into the box displays a greeting below it in real time.

**Select Menu** — Choosing a font size (small, medium, large) changes the size of the sample text below the dropdown.

Files
- `index.html` — page structure and content
- `styles.css` — basic styling
- `script.js` — all three event listeners and DOM changes
